App Bar instructions from Matierail-UI website: https://material-ui.com/demos/app-bar/

After attempting to render MenuAppBar, it kept failing for some reason. Upon researching the errors I was getting with
the Account Cirle and Menu Icons imports, I found an NPM package to import. Found the fix and it worked! :)

NPM packages found to help MenuAppBar to render: 
https://www.npmjs.com/package/@material-ui/icons
https://www.npmjs.com/package/prop-types
